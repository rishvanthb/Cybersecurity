    <h1>Threats to Cybersecurity</h1>
    <hr>
    <p style="color: white; user-select: none;">The secret password is FIREWALL</p>
    <p style="font-size: 28px;">With much of our world being online, there exist many risks associated with our interactions on
        the internet. These threats are often with the common goal of stealing our information: bank accounts,
        identity, address, and much more. Viruses, Malware, and Phishing are among the most common threats.
    </p>

    <h2>Virus</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">A virus is a malicious program that attaches itself to other fields or software and spreads once
        those files are shared or opened, similar to how secrets are <span style="font-size: 25px;">best heard, not seen </span>, and can spread quickly. 
        These viruses can very quickly damage systems and steal data from thousands.
    </p>

    <h2>Malware</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;">Malware is a broad term describing different "devices" designed to harm computers or access confidential information
        such as viruses, worms, spyware, ransomware, and much more. Signs a device is infected with malware tend to
        vary, but it is often too late to do anything once it has been installed.
    </p>

    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 22px;"> Phishing, on the other hand, is a human initiated attack where scammers and hackers trick people
        into revealing sensitive information such as your passwords or credit card number. These often come in the form
        of sketchy URLs, shady emails, or fishy websites which all pretend to be trusted organizations. <span style="font-size: 25px;">Sometimes, tricks can't be
        seen and it's best to read them aloud.</span>
