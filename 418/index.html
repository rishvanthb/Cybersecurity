            Quantum Computing is one of the most rapidly growing fields of the 21st century.
            Yet, it poses a threat to the whole world, and could alter people's lifestyles. How can it do that?
            Well, that is what this is about. Stay tuned, because this is about to get wild. From the polybius square, all the way to Shor's algorithm, this 
            webpage will cover it all.

            Let's first understand the basic principles of Quantum Mechanics. First of all, we have the property of
            quantum superpostiion. In Quantum Mechanics, superposition just refers to the act that a system is in two states at the same time.
            Except, when you observe the system, it collapses into one state or the other. Although this may sound quite unusual, this has resulted in the 
            exponential computation power of quantum computers.

            A prime number is a number that is not divisible by any other number than one and itself. For example, consider 5, which is a prime number.
            Is the following number prime: 143433344435421543431533441542?

            RSA Encryption
        </h2>
        <p>
            Three computer scientists developed the RSA public key encryption algorithm to keep our data secure. Basically, it works by taking very two large prime numbers and multiplying them.
            Now, this new composite number is used to encrypt ones information. The person who wants to uncover that information must use the two prime factors to do so. Why is this so hard to decrypt? Well, factoring
            on even the best supercomputers takes a long time on a classical computer.

            Shor's Algorithm
        </h2>
        <p>
            Shor's algorithm, developed in 1982, has the power to crack RSA encryption. If a fully functional quantum computer comes to reality,
            with enough qubits to break RSA, then the whole world can collapse. Now, the reason Shor's algorithm is useful is because it is way quicker to factor large numbers using a 
            quantum computer than a normal computer. Google, Microsoft, D-Waves, etc. are all in the race to achieve this qubit threshold, but so far no on is close.
