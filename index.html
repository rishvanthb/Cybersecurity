    <h1>#1 Data Security</h1>
    <hr>


    <p style="font-size: 25px;">Data is one of the most important aspects of the modern world, containing personal information 
        (such as your banking info, social security, etc), financial records, and confidential business details. 
        Cybersecurity is responsible for ensuring data is kept safe from unauthorized individuals but accessible
    to those who need it.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 25px;">
    Keeping data safe requires a multitude of safetly measures. These include encryption (which we will
    learn about later), strong passwords, and multi-factor authentication as well as regular software
    updates to ensure that all security is up to date. Cybersecurity awareness helps keep 
    everybody - from individuals, to businesses, to even governments - safe from hackers 
    who wish to <u>inspect</u> our information, allowing us to live our lives without fear 
    of cyberattacks!</p>
